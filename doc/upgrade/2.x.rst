=========================
Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x
=========================

From 2.x, some features are removed because splitted other extensions or duplicated behaviors.
If you want to use new version by documentation using 1.x, you should upgrade project files.

Configurations
==============

html_js_files/revealjs_js_files
-------------------------------

|THIS| does not ref ``html_js_files`` as list of additional JavaScript files.
It refer only ``revealjs_js_files``.

You must do one of these.

* Copy needy values of ``html_js_files`` to ``revealjs_js_files``
* Sync ``html_js_files`` to ``revealjs_js_files`` (ex: ``revealjs_js_files = html_js_files``)

|THIS| defines kebab-cased directives only, and removed snake-cesed directives.
You must replace cases to run by 2.x.
